# simpleTodo
A jQuery todo list app

## How to use this app
* Start typing your new todo item and press enter to commit.
* Hover over list items to show options.
* Click on a todo item to mark it as complete.
* Click on the trash can (must hover) to delete the todo

## Future edits
I am going to add the following features:
* Move completed items to a new location
* Ability to move between complete and active tasks
* Store deleted items for use with an "undo" function.
